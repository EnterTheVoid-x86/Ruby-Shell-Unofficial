# rsh v1.41 (Short for Ruby SHell)

A "simple" UNIX shell written in Ruby because why not!

Disclamer: This shell shouldn't be ran with Bundle.



Credits to Stargirl-chan on GitHub for the original rsh. This is an unofficial modified fork of it with many added feautres and more. Go check them out, they make awesome stuff, such as cool-tty! Oh and yes, this might be PR'd.
